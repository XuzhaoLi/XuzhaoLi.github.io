# 👨🏻‍💻 About Me

I am **Xuzhao Li <font face="楷体">(李旭钊)</font>**, an incoming M.S. student at **<a href="https://english.bit.edu.cn/">Beijing Institute of Technology (BIT)</a>**, supervised by **<a href="https://ac.bit.edu.cn/szdw/jsml/mssbyznxtyjs1/8285660de0654bf69d52aa08987e752d.htm">Prof. Fang Deng</a>** (IET Fellow).

Before that, I received my B.E. degree in Automation at **<a href="https://ac.bit.edu.cn/">School of Automation (AC)</a>** from **<a href="https://english.bit.edu.cn/">Beijing Institute of Technology (BIT)</a>** in Jun. 2024.

I am grateful to be growing up and studying with my twin brother **<a href="https://xuchen-li.github.io/">Xuchen Li</a>**, which is a truly unique and special experience for me.

My research focuses on **Multi-agent Path Planning**, and **Trajectory Prediction**. If you are interested in my work or would like to collaborate, please feel free to contact me.
